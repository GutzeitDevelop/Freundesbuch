## Technical Decisions

### Architecture Choice: Clean Architecture
**Reasoning**: 
- Clear separation of concerns
- Testability and maintainability
- Independent of frameworks
- Scalable for future features

### State Management: Riverpod
**Reasoning**:
- Type-safe and compile-time safe
- Better testing capabilities
- No context required
- Good performance with minimal rebuilds

### Local Storage: Hive
**Reasoning**:
- Fast NoSQL database
- Works offline
- Encryption support
- Small footprint
- Good Flutter integration

### Navigation: GoRouter
**Reasoning**:
- Declarative routing
- Deep linking support
- Web compatibility for future
- Good integration with Riverpod

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Flutter vs React Native Decision
**Solution**: Chose Flutter for better performance, consistent UI across platforms, and stronger typing with Dart.

### Challenge 2: Dependency Version Conflicts
**Solution**: Updated intl package to 0.20.2 to match flutter_localizations requirements.
