  - IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md for tracking progress

### ðŸ”„ In Progress

- [ ] ERROR_HANDLING.md documentation
- [ ] PERMISSIONS.md documentation
- [ ] PROJECT_ROADMAP.md documentation
- [ ] Platform-specific configuration (iOS/Android)
- [ ] Color scheme and design system
- [ ] Internationalization setup (German/English)

### ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

1. Complete remaining documentation files
2. Configure iOS and Android platform settings
3. Implement color scheme and theme system
4. Set up internationalization with German as primary language
5. Create base UI components
6. Implement core entities and models

## Technical Decisions

### Architecture Choice: Clean Architecture
**Reasoning**: 
- Clear separation of concerns
- Testability and maintainability
- Independent of frameworks
- Scalable for future features

### State Management: Riverpod
**Reasoning**:
- Type-safe and compile-time safe
- Better testing capabilities
- No context required
- Good performance with minimal rebuilds

### Local Storage: Hive
**Reasoning**:
- Fast NoSQL database
- Works offline
- Encryption support
- Small footprint
- Good Flutter integration

### Navigation: GoRouter
**Reasoning**:
- Declarative routing
- Deep linking support
- Web compatibility for future
- Good integration with Riverpod

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Flutter vs React Native Decision
**Solution**: Chose Flutter for better performance, consistent UI across platforms, and stronger typing with Dart.

### Challenge 2: Dependency Version Conflicts
**Solution**: Updated intl package to 0.20.2 to match flutter_localizations requirements.

## Performance Metrics

- **Initial Setup Time**: ~15 minutes
- **Dependency Installation**: Successful with 130 packages
- **Project Structure**: Clean architecture with feature-based organization

## Security Measures Implemented

1. **Git Security**
   - Added comprehensive .gitignore patterns
   - Excluded all sensitive file types
   - Prevented credential commits

2. **Dependency Security**
   - Using flutter_secure_storage for sensitive data
   - Crypto package for encryption
   - Latest stable versions of all packages

## Code Quality Standards

- Clean code principles enforced
- Feature-based folder structure
- Consistent naming conventions
- Documentation for all major components

## Testing Strategy

- Target: 80% code coverage
- Test-driven development approach
- Unit, widget, and integration tests planned

## Notes for Reviewers

1. All dependencies chosen are free for commercial use
2. Security-first approach implemented from start
3. Offline-first architecture prioritized
4. Clean separation between layers maintained
