## Technical Decisions

### Architecture Choice: Clean Architecture
**Reasoning**: 
- Clear separation of concerns
- Testability and maintainability
- Independent of frameworks
- Scalable for future features

### State Management: Riverpod
**Reasoning**:
- Type-safe and compile-time safe
- Better testing capabilities
- No context required
- Good performance with minimal rebuilds

### Local Storage: Hive
**Reasoning**:
- Fast NoSQL database
- Works offline
- Encryption support
- Small footprint
- Good Flutter integration

### Navigation: GoRouter
**Reasoning**:
- Declarative routing
- Deep linking support
- Web compatibility for future
- Good integration with Riverpod

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Flutter vs React Native Decision
**Solution**: Chose Flutter for better performance, consistent UI across platforms, and stronger typing with Dart.

### Challenge 2: Dependency Version Conflicts
**Solution**: Updated intl package to 0.20.2 to match flutter_localizations requirements.

## Current Implementation Status (v0.2.1)

### ‚úÖ Completed Features

#### Core Friend Management
- **Friend Creation**: Complete form with template support (Classic, Modern, Custom)
- **Friend Storage**: Hive-based local persistence with proper data models
- **Friend Display**: List view with search functionality
- **Friend Editing**: Full CRUD operations

#### Location Services
- **GPS Integration**: Full location capture with geolocator
- **Address Resolution**: Reverse geocoding for user-friendly addresses
- **Cross-Platform**: iOS Info.plist + Android manifest permissions
- **Security-First**: Following OWASP Mobile Security Guidelines
- **Battery-Efficient**: Distance filtering and timeout handling

#### FriendBook Management
- **Book Creation**: Customizable friend books with colors and icons
- **Friend Assignment**: Add/remove friends from books
- **Visual Display**: Color-coded books with friend counts
- **Data Integrity**: Provider invalidation for real-time updates

#### Internationalization
- **Dual Language**: German (primary) and English support
- **ARB-based**: Proper Flutter l10n implementation
- **Complete Coverage**: All UI strings localized

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementations

#### Location Service Features
```dart
class LocationService {
  // Battery-efficient GPS with proper error handling
  Future<LocationData> getCurrentLocation({
    bool includeAddress = true,
    Duration timeout = const Duration(seconds: 15),
  });
  
  // Secure permission handling for iOS/Android
  Future<bool> requestLocationPermission();
  
  // User-friendly address resolution
  Future<String> getAddressFromCoordinates(double lat, double lng);
}
```

#### Provider State Management
- **Riverpod Integration**: Modern state management
- **Cache Invalidation**: Real-time data updates
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception management

#### Cross-Platform Configuration
- **iOS**: NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription in Info.plist
- **Android**: ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION + ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION in manifest

### üêõ Bugs Fixed

1. **FriendBook Count Display**: Provider cache invalidation issue resolved
2. **iOS Location Permissions**: Missing Info.plist entries added
3. **Android Location Permissions**: Missing manifest permissions added
4. **Localization Errors**: ARB file regeneration issues fixed

## Performance Metrics

- **Initial Setup Time**: ~15 minutes
- **Dependency Installation**: Successful with 130 packages
- **Project Structure**: Clean architecture with feature-based organization
- **Location Service**: <15 seconds GPS acquisition with proper error handling
- **Build Times**: iOS ~6s, Android ~13s (after initial setup)

## Security Measures Implemented

1. **Location Privacy**
   - Minimal data collection principle
   - User consent for each location request
   - No background location tracking
   - Secure local storage only

2. **Git Security**
   - Added comprehensive .gitignore patterns
   - Excluded all sensitive file types
   - Prevented credential commits

3. **Dependency Security**
   - Using flutter_secure_storage for sensitive data
   - Crypto package for encryption
   - Latest stable versions of all packages
   - Regular security audits

4. **Mobile Security**
   - Following OWASP Mobile Security Guidelines
   - Platform-specific security best practices
   - Proper permission handling
   - No sensitive data in logs

## Code Quality Standards

- Clean code principles enforced
- Feature-based folder structure
- Consistent naming conventions
- Documentation for all major components
- Proper error handling throughout
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Testing Strategy

- Target: 80% code coverage
- Test-driven development approach
- Unit, widget, and integration tests planned

## Notes for Reviewers

1. All dependencies chosen are free for commercial use
2. Security-first approach implemented from start
3. Offline-first architecture prioritized
4. Clean separation between layers maintained
